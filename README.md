# Val d'oise townhall's emails scrapper of death

**This is a Ruby project** and it's good

## And this is a subtitle. Useless

It kicks some ass. It first collects all the emails of the townhalls in Val d'Oise. We pull the infos from [annuaire des mairies](annuaire-des-mairies.com). We parse all that data with xpath. The parsed data is saved in a hash. That hash is then converted and exported in three formats :
- sent to Google spreadsheet via the API
- CSV via built-in methods
- JSON via built-in methods

**You're skeptical ??!!** Well just try it ! You'll see for yourself.
